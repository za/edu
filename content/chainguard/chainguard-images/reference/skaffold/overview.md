Minimal container image for running skaffold apps

The image specifies a default non-root `skaffold` user (UID 65532), and a working directory at `/app`, owned by that `skaffold` user, and accessible to all users.

## Get It!

The image is available on `cgr.dev`:

```
docker pull cgr.dev/chainguard/skaffold:latest
```

This image includes `skaffold`, `helm`, `kubectl`, `kpt`, `kustomize`, and the `google-cloud-sdk.`

## Usage

This image should be a drop-in replacement for the upstream `skaffold-slim` image.
See the [full documentation](https://skaffold.dev/docs/install/#standalone-binary) for usage.
